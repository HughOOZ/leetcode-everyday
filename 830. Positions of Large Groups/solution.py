'''Approach #1: Two Pointer [Accepted]
Intuition

We scan through the string to identify the start and end of each group. If the size of the group is at least 3, we add it to the answer.

Algorithm

Maintain pointers i, j with i <= j. The i pointer will represent the start of the current group, and we will increment j forward until it reaches the end of the group.

We know that we have reached the end of the group when j is at the end of the string, or S[j] != S[j+1]. At this point, we have some group [i, j]; and after, we will update i = j+1, the start of the next group.'''

        for j in xrange(len(S)):
            if j == len(S) - 1 or S[j] != S[j+1]:
                # Here, [i, j] represents a group.
                if j-i+1 >= 3:
                    ans.append([i, j])
                i = j+1
        return ans
